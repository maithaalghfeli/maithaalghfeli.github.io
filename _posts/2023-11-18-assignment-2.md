I chose Jane Austen’s books because they are available on Project Gutenberg, and I enjoy the film adaptations of her writing. Keira Knightley in Pride and Prejudice, Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility, as well as Dakota Johnson in Persuasion are among my all time favourite text adapted film characters. I can use the films as a base for comparison to what I find in the books through the analysis tools, which can give me a richer understanding of how adaptations work. Jane Austen also submitted her works under an alias male name because of the time period’s distaste for female writers. I wanted to see whether that could have possibly affected her way of writing. Although I am aware that with only Austen’s books I am unable to grasp the differences in feminine versus masculine writing trends, I might be able to extract surface level topics or subjects Austen discusses that pertain to feminine matters. 

Jane Austen (1775-1817) was an English novelist who wrote during a time when female writers faced challenges and were often looked down upon in the literary world. Austen's novels often explored the social and economic aspects of her time, focusing on the lives and relationships of the British landed gentry. While her novels were published anonymously, she gained recognition posthumously, and her works have since become classics.

**Pride and Prejudice (1813):
<br>Book Reference: 42671**

Pride and Prejudice follows the story of Elizabeth Bennet, one of five sisters, as she navigates the social hierarchy and expectations of marriage in early 19th-century England. The novel explores themes of love, class, and personal growth, and it is particularly known for its portrayal of the complex relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.

**Sense and Sensibility (1811):
<br>Book Reference: 21839**

Sense and Sensibility revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who face financial difficulties after their father's death. The novel contrasts Elinor's practical and reserved demeanour (sense) with Marianne's passionate and emotional nature (sensibility). The story explores the challenges and rewards of balancing reason and emotion in matters of love and societal expectations.

**Persuasion (1818):
<br>Book Reference: 105**

Persuasion tells the story of Anne Elliot, who, persuaded by others, broke off an engagement with Captain Frederick Wentworth years earlier. The novel explores themes of second chances and the consequences of societal expectations. As Anne and Captain Wentworth cross paths again, they must confront their past and navigate the complexities of love and social status.

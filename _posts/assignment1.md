## PART I:
</br>
The first step of the assignment is to compare parsing through the Harvard Art Museum’s collections and objects through their website to their CSV file from the Posit Cloud Jupyter Notebooks. This part of the assignment was started in class, and from the get-go it was clear that reading through a CSV file is not a simple feat. It is simply not very human friendly because all the information runs together as one large body. However, through the Harvard Art Museum’s web interface, objects from the collections are more often accompanied by photographs of the artefact as well as the information needed to understand its history and significance. 

I was very intrigued by the idea of Special Collections on the HAM website, therefore, my collection focus was on that. Allan Burrough’s Collection of X-radiographs specifically interested me because the radiographs resembled art pieces of printmaking. I am currently enrolled in a printmaking class and it took me a while to realise radiographs were a form of photography and not printing. However, as soon as I started to dig deeper into this collection, I realised a lot of the pieces were not photographed, therefore there was no visual reference to them in the collection. I lost interest in the pieces that had no visual reference and only focused on the ones I can actually see. It made me question things like accessibility and how our eyes affect the way we interact with screens, and even physical spaces such as museums. On the HAM website, I was also able to see certain information about the pieces, such as who the original artist of the art that was radiographed is, its title, and object number.

On the other hand, when I was trying to make sense of the CSV file to find an object, I found myself randomly selecting one instead of taking the time to read them. Although I do understand the structure of CSV files, and on the very top of the file it lays out exactly how each entry will be documented: “ID,title,description,century,...” it was not hard to extract information about certain pieces. With that said, the CSV file was just too overwhelming to parse through normally as a human being, and especially for me as a visual learner. So I resorted to simple scrolling endlessly and picking out a line with my eyes closed to investigate further. I picked out the piece on line 594 from the CSV file, and from the information provided, I was able to extract the ID, title, and a few other details, and was more than pleased with my selection. The piece that I stumbled upon is titled “What a Glorious Land!” a Chinese painting dated to the 21st century and filed under Asian and Mediterranean Art. The piece was acquired by the HAM in 2006 and I was lucky enough to get a description that read: “This handscroll depicts a range of tree-covered mountains shrouded in mist. A title written by the artist precedes the painting; the title is a line from a 1936 poem by Mao Zedong and reads “Jiangshan ruci dou jiao”. It can be translated as “What a Glorious Land!”, though it is also translated as “This land, so rich in beauty.” Although this short description, and the details that came through the CSV file were very informative, I was more intrigued to copy the link into google just to see the images. Let’s just say, I was more than pleased with it. 

What I appreciated about parsing through the CSV file, is the ease by which I can access all the objects and pieces in one place instead of clicking into collections and changing pages to find certain pieces. I also enjoyed how the randomness of scrolling through the file to randomly stop on a line and choose to investigate it has an air of excitement and intrigue that cannot be achieved by looking through a website. Although it is very tiring on the eye, the CSV file is the simplest form of including all the basic information of ALL the pieces in the museum in one single place. On the other hand, even with researching the Chinese scroll from the CSV file, I copied the URL and pasted it into google to be directed to the HAM website where I realised just how much more information is available on the piece, not just visually, but also details on the artist, physical descriptions of the piece, and creation place all of which were not included in the CSV file.

## PART II:

For the second part of this exercise, I made sure to choose a culture that had a relatively small number of objects on the HAM website whilst still being somewhat relevant to my Arab background. That way I will be able to analyse all the objects against one another to determine why one is more or less relevant in terms of pageviews and to have an understanding of the art’s meaning in some form as well thereby deepening my analysis. 

I chose the Moroccan culture off of the CSV file titled All_Culture_information.csv which had a total of 28 object entries. Twenty-eight objects gives me a large enough pool of information to compare while still staying somewhat small enough to look at every object closely.

Since Moroccan culture has existed for over a thousand years, I avoided specifying a century in the initial run of the program as I wanted to see what time period the objects collected by the Harvard Art Museum came from or whether they were periodically spread out. I started with the descending classification of Moroccan culture to get a sense of what people were intrigued by or searched for more.

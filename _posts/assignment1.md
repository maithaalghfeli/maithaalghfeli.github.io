## PART I:
</br>
The first step of the assignment is to compare parsing through the Harvard Art Museum’s collections and objects through their website to their CSV file from the Posit Cloud Jupyter Notebooks. This part of the assignment was started in class, and from the get-go it was clear that reading through a CSV file is not a simple feat. It is simply not very human friendly because all the information runs together as one large body. However, through the Harvard Art Museum’s web interface, objects from the collections are more often accompanied by photographs of the artefact as well as the information needed to understand its history and significance. 

I was very intrigued by the idea of Special Collections on the HAM website, therefore, my collection focus was on that. Allan Burrough’s Collection of X-radiographs specifically interested me because the radiographs resembled art pieces of printmaking. I am currently enrolled in a printmaking class and it took me a while to realise radiographs were a form of photography and not printing. However, as soon as I started to dig deeper into this collection, I realised a lot of the pieces were not photographed, therefore there was no visual reference to them in the collection. I lost interest in the pieces that had no visual reference and only focused on the ones I can actually see. It made me question things like accessibility and how our eyes affect the way we interact with screens, and even physical spaces such as museums. On the HAM website, I was also able to see certain information about the pieces, such as who the original artist of the art that was radiographed is, its title, and object number.

### This site is a reflection of my semester long coursework under the mentorship of Professor David Wrisley at NYUAD. 

On the site, you will find my work in data analysis through various tools and algorithms. Assignments 1, 2, and 3, each explore a different method of analysis whether through creating thematic word clouds or geocoding and spatial mapping. You can learn more about the work I have done for the class and my digital literacy growth over the semester by reading the DLN page. 

If you're thinking of taking this course, definitely do so!!! Everything you learn here is CRUCIAL information to know after your time at NYUAD. We leverage tools and data necessary for the production of projects needed to change the world.

*p.s. this might genuinely be the most real-world useful course I have taken at NYU thus far*

As a 21-year-old university student, I enrolled in a new and interesting course this semester that will introduce me to the Digital Humanities. I aspire through this course to transform the way I perceive, interact with, and create content digitally. This narrative explores my evolving understanding of digital literacy, the strategies I employ in my personal and academic life, and my aspirations for what lies ahead.

### My Digital Starting Point

<br/>
Before enrolling in this course, my digital literacy skills were primarily centered around the basics. I know how to use social media platforms, Google and Microsoft suites, as well as some basic code and web development. My content creation process revolves around simple tools available on my iPhone and Macbook, and I hardly ever venture beyond that comfort zone unrelated to classes I am enrolled in. Socially, I interact with friends and family on Instagram, Snapchat, Tiktok, and Whatsapp, and I tend to stay away from delving into the deeper aspects of online communities or digital communication.

In my day-to-day life, I rely on digital spaces on the web such as Google Drive, Google Calendar, and Notion to organise my documents and manage my time, but I never truly explored the wealth of digital tools available for research, data management, and analysis. Frankly, I was swimming in the shallow end of the digital pool, unaware of the vast ocean of possibilities that awaited.

### Aspiration For This Course

<br/>
I hope that enrolling in the Digital Humanities course will be a pivotal step. The course aims to expose us to a plethora of digital tools and concepts around data research, analysis, and management. Such as in this assignment, languages like Markdown become my go-to for formatting text on platforms like GitHub which allow me to create and collaborate with others on coding projects. I began to see how online communities on unconventional social platforms formed around shared interests, and I realized the potential for networking and learning from experts in various fields.

However, the true eye-opener was when we delved into research data management and analysis. We explored data manipulation with Posit Cloud and data visualization with tools like Voyant and Antconc, illuminating the power of data-driven insights.

My current abilities have grown significantly, but I am keenly aware of how much more there is to learn. The course has ignited a passion for digital humanities, pushing me to seek further knowledge independently. I now understand that digital literacy is not a static skill but a constantly evolving journey. I aspire to become proficient in data analysis, mastering statistical techniques and data visualization tools to unlock the potential of big data in humanities research.

### Future Aims and Exploring the Ethical

<br/>
Furthermore, I am intrigued by the ethical implications of digital humanities. As we navigate the digital landscape, questions about data privacy, biases in algorithms, and the accessibility of digital content are more relevant than ever. I hope to explore these issues deeply and contribute to discussions on responsible and equitable digital practices.

In conclusion, I hope my journey into digital humanities will be a transformative experience. While my current abilities have grown, I am acutely aware of the vast expanse of knowledge yet to be explored. My aspirations include mastering data analysis, understanding the ethical complexities of the digital world, and continuing to adapt and evolve as a digital citizen. This course has opened my eyes to the possibilities and responsibilities that come with digital literacy, and I am excited to continue my journey in this ever-evolving digital wilderness.
